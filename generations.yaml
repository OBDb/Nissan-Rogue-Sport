    description: "The Nissan Rogue Sport, essentially the North American version of the second-generation Nissan Qashqai sold globally, was introduced to fill the gap between the Juke and the larger Rogue in Nissan's crossover lineup. Built on the same CMF platform as the Rogue but approximately 12 inches shorter overall and with a 2.3-inch shorter wheelbase, it featured similar styling with Nissan's V-motion grille design, boomerang-shaped lights, and floating roof aesthetic. Powered exclusively by a 2.0L four-cylinder engine producing 141 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive. The interior offered seating for five with no third-row option, featuring a straightforward design with available features including a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Around View Monitor 360-degree camera system, and heated front seats. Safety technology expanded throughout its production run, eventually including Nissan Safety Shield 360 with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, high beam assist, and rear automatic braking. A refresh for 2020 brought updated exterior styling with a more pronounced grille, redesigned bumpers, and new wheel designs, alongside interior refinements and expanded safety features. The Rogue Sport established itself as a more city-friendly alternative to the standard Rogue, appealing to buyers seeking crossover styling and a higher seating position in a more compact package, though its relatively high price compared to competitors and modest performance limited its market impact. Production for the North American market ended after the 2022 model year, though the Qashqai continues in other global markets in its third generation."
