    description: "The Nissan Rogue Sport, the North American rebadged version of the second-generation Qashqai (J11), was introduced to fill the gap between the Juke and the larger Rogue in Nissan's crossover lineup. Built on the same CMF platform as the Rogue but approximately 12 inches shorter overall and with a 2.3-inch shorter wheelbase, it featured Nissan's V-motion grille design, boomerang-shaped lights, and floating roof aesthetic. Powered exclusively by a 2.0L four-cylinder engine producing 141 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive. The interior offered seating for five with no third-row option, featuring a straightforward design with available features including a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Around View Monitor 360-degree camera system, and heated front seats. Safety technology included available automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane departure warning. The Rogue Sport established itself as a more city-friendly alternative to the standard Rogue, appealing to buyers seeking crossover styling and a higher seating position in a more compact package. Trim levels included S, SV, and SL."

Safety features were expanded with the inclusion of Nissan Safety Shield 360 as standard on higher trims, which includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, high beam assist, and rear automatic braking.

Production for the North American market ended in December 2022, making 2022 the final model year for the US Rogue Sport, though the Qashqai continues in other global markets."
